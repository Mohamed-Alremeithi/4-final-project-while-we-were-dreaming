## Product Vision Statement

While We Were Dreaming is a location-based platform designed to connect NYU students through the shared memories they create on campus. By pinning personal experiences to a dynamic map, students can reflect on key moments of their college journey and explore the memories of others enhanced by anonymity. This platform fosters a sense of community and nostalgia, bridging the emotional gap often felt in an open-city campus like NYU. The map becomes a collective memory, capturing the dreams and experiences of past, present, and future students.
